                <p style="font-size: x-large;">The Green Mile is a 1999 American fantasy crime drama film written,
                    directed and co-produced by Frank Darabont and based on the 1996 novel by Stephen King. It stars Tom
                    Hanks as a death row prison guard during the Great Depression who witnesses supernatural events
                    following the arrival of an enigmatic convict (Michael Clarke Duncan) at his facility. David Morse,
                    Bonnie Hunt, Sam Rockwell, and James Cromwell appear in supporting roles.

                    The film premiered in the United States on December 10, 1999, to positive reviews from critics, who
                    praised Darabont's direction and writing, emotional weight, and performances (particularly for Hanks
                    and Duncan), although its length received criticism. It was a commercial success, grossing $286.8
                    million from its $60 million budget, and was nominated for four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best
                    Supporting Actor for Duncan, Best Sound, and Best Adapted Screenplay.</p>

                    <p style="font-size: x-large; text-align: left;">At a Louisiana assisted-living home in 1999,
                        retiree Paul Edgecomb begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His companion Elaine
                        becomes concerned, and Paul explains to her that the film reminded him of events that he
                        witnessed when he was an officer at Cold Mountain Penitentiary's death row, nicknamed "The Green
                        Mile".
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1935, Paul supervised corrections officers Brutus "Brutal" Howell, Dean Stanton, Harry
                        Terwilliger, and Percy Wetmore, reporting to Warden Hal Moores. Percy, the nephew of the state
                        governor's wife, demonstrates a severe sadistic streak but flaunts his family connections to
                        avoid punishment. He is particularly abusive towards prisoner Eduard "Del" Delacroix, breaking
                        his fingers and killing his pet mouse, Mr. Jingles.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Paul is introduced to John Coffey, a physically imposing but gentle and timid black man
                        sentenced to death after being convicted of raping and murdering two young white girls. He joins
                        Del and another condemned convict, Native American Arlen Bitterbuck, the first to be executed in
                        the electric chair. The officers are forced to deal with psychotic new inmate William "Wild
                        Bill" Wharton, who frequently causes trouble by assaulting the officers and racially abusing
                        John, forcing them to restrain him in the block's padded cell on more than one occasion.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After John heals Paul's severe bladder infection by touching him, and later resurrects Mr.
                        Jingles, Paul gradually realizes that John possesses a supernatural ability to heal others. Paul
                        doubts whether someone with the power to perform divine miracles is truly guilty of the crime.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In exchange for resigning from the penitentiary and accepting a job at an insane asylum, Percy
                        is allowed to oversee Del's execution. At the execution, Percy deliberately avoids soaking the
                        sponge used to conduct electricity to Del's head, leading to Del suffering a gruesome and
                        agonizing death by electrocution, with John forced to feel Del's pain as well. Paul and the
                        other officers punish Percy by forcing him to spend a night in the padded cell. While Percy is
                        locked away, they drug Wharton and secretly smuggle John out of the prison so that he can use
                        his powers to heal Warden Moores' wife Melinda of a brain tumor, saving her life. After Percy is
                        released from the padded room, the others threaten to report him for his various acts of
                        misconduct if his behavior continues.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        John uses his powers to "release" Melinda's affliction into Percy's brain, causing Percy to
                        shoot Wharton dead. Soon after, John reveals in a vision to Paul that Wharton was the true
                        culprit of the crimes for which he was wrongfully condemned, releasing his supernatural energy
                        into Paul in the process. Having gone into a catatonic state, Percy is ironically committed to
                        the same insane asylum where he had planned to work after resigning from the prison.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        After realizing that John is innocent, Paul becomes distraught at the thought of executing him
                        and offers to let him go free. Although equally distraught at the outcome, John tells Paul that
                        the execution would be an act of mercy, as he views the world as a cruel place and is in
                        constant pain from the suffering that people inflict upon each other. Mentioning that he has
                        never seen a movie before, John watches Top Hat with Paul and the other officers as his last
                        request. As John is taken to be executed, he is mercilessly scorned by the parents of the two
                        girls who still believe him to be guilty. He asks not to have the hood which normally covers the
                        face of the prisoner in the electric chair placed over his head as he is afraid of the dark, and
                        Paul agrees. Paul, Brutal, Dean, Harry and the other officers watch in great sorrow, crying and
                        holding back tears, as John is executed on Paul's order.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Back in the present day, Paul tells Elaine that John's execution was the last that he and Brutal
                        witnessed, as they both subsequently resigned from the prison and took up jobs in the juvenile
                        system. Paul reveals to Elaine that Mr. Jingles is still alive, having been blessed with a
                        supernaturally long life thanks to John's healing touch. He also reveals that he is now 108
                        years old; he was 44 when John was executed. While Elaine sees Paul's long life as another of
                        John's miracles, Paul speculates that he may have been condemned to linger on Earth and outlive
                        all of his loved ones as a divine punishment for John's execution. Paul later attends Elaine's
                        funeral and muses on how much longer he has left to live, saying, "We each owe a death. There
                        are no exceptions. But, oh, God... sometimes, the Green Mile seems so long."
