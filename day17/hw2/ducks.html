                    duck, any of various species of relatively small, short-necked, large-billed waterfowl. In true
                    ducks—i.e., those classified in the subfamily Anatinae in the waterfowl family Anatidae—the legs are
                    placed rearward, as in swans, rather than forward, as in geese. The result is a distinctive waddling
                    gait. Most true ducks, including a few inaccurately called geese (e.g., sheldgeese) by reason of
                    size and build, also differ from swans and true geese in the following characteristics: males
                    (drakes) and females (hens or ducks) exhibit some degree of differentiation in plumage and in call,
                    males molt twice annually, females lay large clutches of smooth-shelled rather than rough-shelled
                    eggs, and both sexes have overlapping scales on the skin of the leg. The wild mallard (Anas
                    platyrhynchos) is believed to be the ancestor of all domestic ducks, and it has undergone numerous
                    crossbreedings and mutations since it was first domesticated in China between 2,000 and 3,000 years
                    ago.

                    All true ducks, except those in the shelduck group (the tribe Tadornini) and sea ducks (the tribes
                    Mergini and Somateriini), mature in the first year and pair only for the season—unlike the
                    late-maturing, life-mating true geese and swans. Ducks are generally divided into three major
                    groups, dabbling (shallow-water), diving, and perching ducks, based on their characteristic
                    behaviours. The mallard, a typical dabbling duck (any of about 38 species of Anas and about 5
                    species in other genera), is one of the most popular game birds.

                    Pintails, teals, shovelers, and wigeons are also dabbling ducks classified in Anas, in addition to
                    the gadwall (A. strepera) and the black ducks (A. sparsa, A. rubripes, and A. superciliosa).
                    Perching ducks such as the muscovy (Cairina moschata), the wood duck (Aix sponsa), and the mandarin
                    duck (Aix galericulata) have long claws and are the most arboreal of ducks, often roosting in trees.
                    The diving ducks (or sea ducks) include the greatest number of marine species, such as eiders (which
                    are variously classified as members of the tribe Mergini or placed in a separate tribe Somateriini)
                    and scoters (Melanitta), but they also include primarily freshwater species such as mergansers
                    (Mergus and Lophodytes), the ring-necked duck (Aythya collaris), and the pochards (Aythya and
                    Netta), including the scaups (A. marila, A. affinis, and A. novaeseelandiae) and the canvasback (A.
                    valisineria). The redhead (A. americana), the goldeneye (Bucephala clangula and B. islandica), and
                    the bufflehead (B. albeola) are diving ducks that live in fresh and salt water, depending on the
                    season. Members of the stifftail group, typified by the blue-billed ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis),
                    are highly aquatic diving ducks characterized by legs set far toward the rear of the body. The
                    whistling ducks (Dendrocygna), also called tree ducks, are not true ducks but are more closely
                    related to geese and swans. Ducks that are not included in those larger groups are the freckled duck
                    (Stictonetta naevosa) and the torrent duck (Merganetta armata), as well as the shelducks (Tadorna)
                    and the steamer ducks (Tachyeres). All ducks, geese, and swans belong to the family Anatidae. For a
                    more detailed classification, see anseriform.

                    Duck raising is practiced on a limited scale in most countries, usually as a small-farm enterprise,
                    although large flocks are bred in some areas of England, the Netherlands, and the United States. The
                    American Poultry Association lists 17 domesticated breeds, divided into four classes: heavy, medium,
                    lightweight, and bantam. The White Pekin, originally from China, is the most widely raised duck in
                    the United States, because it is meaty, fast growing, and prodigious in egg production. Duck
                    feathers are also of some value, though they have been largely replaced by synthetics. Eiderdown,
                    the down feathers of the common eider (Somateria mollissima), are still of wide commercial value for
                    use in luxury quilts and pillows.

                        Mallard duckling preening
                        Ducks eat food sources such as grasses, aquatic plants, fish, insects, small amphibians, worms,
                        and small molluscs.
                        <br>
                        Dabbling ducks feed on the surface of water or on land, or as deep as they can reach by
                        up-ending without completely submerging. Along the edge of the bill, there is a comb-like
                        structure called a pecten. This strains the water squirting from the side of the bill and traps
                        any food. The pecten is also used to preen feathers and to hold slippery food items.
                        <br>
                        Diving ducks and sea ducks forage deep underwater. To be able to submerge more easily, the
                        diving ducks are heavier than dabbling ducks, and therefore have more difficulty taking off to
                        fly.
                        <br>
                        A few specialized species such as the mergansers are adapted to catch and swallow large fish.
                        <br>
                        The others have the characteristic wide flat bill adapted to dredging-type jobs such as pulling
                        up waterweed, pulling worms and small molluscs out of mud, searching for insect larvae, and bulk
                        jobs such as dredging out, holding, turning head first, and swallowing a squirming frog. To
                        avoid injury when digging into sediment it has no cere, but the nostrils come out through hard
                        horn.
                        <br>
                        The Guardian published an article advising that ducks should not be fed with bread because it
                        damages the health of the ducks and pollutes waterways.

                        <b>Breeding:</b>
                        <br>
                        A Muscovy duckling
                        Ducks generally only have one partner at a time, although the partnership usually only lasts one
                        year. Larger species and the more sedentary species (like fast-river specialists) tend to
                        have pair-bonds that last numerous years. Most duck species breed once a year, choosing to
                        do so in favourable conditions (spring/summer or wet seasons). Ducks also tend to make a nest
                        before breeding, and, after hatching, lead their ducklings to water. Mother ducks are very
                        caring and protective of their young, but may abandon some of their ducklings if they are
                        physically stuck in an area they cannot get out of (such as nesting in an enclosed courtyard) or
                        are not prospering due to genetic defects or sickness brought about by hypothermia, starvation,
                        or disease. Ducklings can also be orphaned by inconsistent late hatching where a few eggs hatch
                        after the mother has abandoned the nest and led her ducklings to water.
                        <br>
                        Communication
                        Female mallard ducks (as well as several other species in the genus Anas, such as the American
                        and Pacific black ducks, spot-billed duck, northern pintail and common teal) make the classic
                        "quack" sound while males make a similar but raspier sound that is sometimes written as
                        "breeeeze",[self-published source?] but, despite widespread misconceptions, most species of
                        duck do not "quack". In general, ducks make a range of calls, including whistles, cooing,
                        yodels and grunts. For example, the scaup – which are diving ducks – make a noise like "scaup"
                        (hence their name). Calls may be loud displaying calls or quieter contact calls.
                        <br>
                        A common urban legend claims that duck quacks do not echo; however, this has been proven to be
                        false. This myth was first debunked by the Acoustics Research Centre at the University of
                        Salford in 2003 as part of the British Association's Festival of Science. It was also
                        debunked in one of the earlier episodes of the popular Discovery Channel television show
                        MythBusters.

                        <br>
                        Ringed teal
                        Ducks have many predators. Ducklings are particularly vulnerable, since their inability to fly
                        makes them easy prey not only for predatory birds but also for large fish like pike,
                        crocodilians, predatory testudines such as the alligator snapping turtle, and other aquatic
                        hunters, including fish-eating birds such as herons. Ducks' nests are raided by land-based
                        predators, and brooding females may be caught unaware on the nest by mammals, such as foxes, or
                        large birds, such as hawks or owls.
                        <br>
                        Adult ducks are fast fliers, but may be caught on the water by large aquatic predators including
                        big fish such as the North American muskie and the European pike. In flight, ducks are safe from
                        all but a few predators such as humans and the peregrine falcon, which uses its speed and
                        strength to catch ducks.
