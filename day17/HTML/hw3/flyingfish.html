                    The Exocoetidae are a family of marine ray-finned fish in the order Beloniformes, known colloquially
                    as
                    flying fish or flying cod. About 64 species are grouped in seven genera. While they cannot fly in
                    the
                    same way a bird does, flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of the water where
                    their
                    long wing-like fins enable gliding for considerable distances above the water's surface. The main
                    reason
                    for this behavior is thought to be to escape from underwater predators, which include
                    swordfish, mackerel, tuna, and marlin, among others, though their periods of flight expose them to
                    attack by avian predators such as frigate birds.

                    Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish" and the fish is one of the national symbols of
                    the
                    country. The Exocet missile is named after them, as variants are launched from underwater, and take
                    a
                    low trajectory, skimming the surface, before striking their targets.

                        Barbados is known as "the land of the flying fish", and the fish is one of the national symbols
                        of the country. Once abundant, it migrated between the warm, coral-filled Atlantic Ocean
                        surrounding the island of Barbados and the plankton-rich outflows of the Orinoco River in
                        Venezuela.
                        <br>
                        Just after the completion of the Bridgetown Harbor / Deep Water Harbor in Bridgetown, Barbados
                        had an increase of ship visits, linking the island to the world. The overall health of the coral
                        reefs surrounding Barbados suffered due to ship-based pollution. Additionally, Barbadian
                        overfishing pushed them closer to the Orinoco delta, no longer returning to Barbados in large
                        numbers. Today, the flying fish only migrate as far north as Tobago, around 120 nmi (220 km; 140
                        mi) southwest of Barbados. Despite the change, flying fish remain a coveted delicacy.

                        Many aspects of Barbadian culture center around the flying fish; it is depicted on coins, as
                        sculptures in fountains, in artwork, and as part of the official logo of the Barbados Tourism
                        Authority. Additionally, the Barbadian coat of arms features a pelican and dolphinfish on either
                        side of the shield, but the dolphinfish resembles a flying fish. Furthermore, actual artistic
                        renditions and holograms of the flying fish are also present within the Barbadian
                        passport.

                        Flying fish have also been gaining in popularity in other islands, fueling several maritime
                        disputes. In 2006, the council of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
                        the maritime boundaries between Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago over the flying fish dispute,
                        which gradually raised tensions between the neighbours. The ruling stated both countries
                        must preserve stocks for the future. Barbadian fishers still follow the flying fish southward.

                        Makassar fishermen in south Sulawesi have been catching flying fish (torani) in special boats
                        called patorani for centuries developing their own sailing traditions along the way. These
                        fishermen were able to sail as far as Kimberley region in west of Australia reaching the
