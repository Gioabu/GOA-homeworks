        What is Horror Fiction?
        <br>
        Horror is a genre of literature, film, and television that is meant to scare, startle, shock, and even repulse
        audiences. The key focus of a horror novel, horror film, or horror TV show is to elicit a sense of dread in the
        reader through frightening images, themes, and situations. In the horror genre, story and characters are just as
        important as mood and atmosphere. A horror story often shocks and provokes with its exploration of the unknown.

        The horror genre in literature dates back to Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, where horror stories explored
        themes
        related to death, demons, evil spirits, and the afterlife. Examples include the ancient Greek tragedy Hippolytus
        by
        Euripides, a gruesome story about how jealousy and a lack of empathy can lead to tragedy; and Parallel Lives by
        Plutarch, a series of biographies highlighting the many moral failures of man.

        The gothic novel, a genre of horror that focuses specifically on death, originated in the eighteenth century and
        is
        exemplified by the author Edgar Allan Poe. Horror literature in the nineteenth century and twentieth centuries
        often
        focused on tales involving occult ideas, like Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein (1818) or Bram Stoker’s Dracula (1897).

        Modern horror novels have expanded the genre to include new elements and contemporary themes, like serial
        killers
        and slasher stories—Stephen King’s The Shining (1977) is a perfect example—as well as genre mashups that combine
        horror with historical fantasy, and modern interpretations of fantastical creatures, like ghosts, vampires,
        werewolves, and witches.

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The horror genre has several sub-genres, each with its own distinct characteristics.
        <br>
        <br>
        1. Gothic: horror novels that focus specifically on death.
        <br>
        2. Paranormal: horror novels involving ghost stories or supernatural horror events that do not exist within the
        context of scientific explanation.
        <br>
        3. Occult: horror novels about ritual practices that are not considered religion or science.
        <br>
        4. Dark fantasy: horror novels that blend dark elements of fantasy.
        <br>
        5. Survival: horror novels in which the main character is being hunted and trying to survive within their
        circumstances.
        <br>
        6. Science fiction horror: horror novels that blend elements of science fiction.

        <strong> “The Horror Story is a primal external genre, an allegory for the horrific world we presently or could
            soon
            inhabit. It serves as a prescriptive or cautionary tale about how best to metabolize our darkest fears and
            survive. The power gap between the monster and the victim is immense and thus the victim who raises the
            courage
            to confront the force with all of their inner genius to their last breath inspires us to do the same. To win
            is
            to survive.”— Shawn Coyne</strong>

        <h1>History of horror genre</h1>
        <img src="./assets/images/horror/historyofhorror.jpg" alt="historyofhorror">

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        The horror genre has ancient origins, with roots in folklore and religious traditions focusing on death, the
        afterlife, evil, the demonic, and the principle of the thing embodied in the person. These manifested in stories
        of beings such as demons, witches, vampires, werewolves, and ghosts. European horror-fiction became established
        through works of the Ancient Greeks and Ancient Romans.Mary Shelley's well-known 1818 novel about Frankenstein
        was greatly influenced by the story of Hippolytus, whom Asclepius revives from death. Euripides wrote plays
        based
        on the story, Hippolytos Kalyptomenos and Hippolytus. In Plutarch's The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans
        in
        the account of Cimon, the author describes the spirit of a murderer, Damon, who himself was murdered in a
        bathhouse
        in Chaeronea.

        Pliny the Younger (61 to c. 113) tells the tale of Athenodorus Cananites, who bought a haunted house in Athens.
        Athenodorus was cautious since the house seemed inexpensive. While writing a book on philosophy, he was visited
        by a
        ghostly figure bound in chains. The figure disappeared in the courtyard; the following day, the magistrates dug
        in
        the courtyard and found an unmarked grave.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>18th century</strong>
        <br>
        The 18th century saw the gradual development of Romanticism and the Gothic horror genre. It drew on the written
        and
        material heritage of the Late Middle Ages, finding its form with Horace Walpole's seminal and controversial 1764
        novel, The Castle of Otranto. In fact, the first edition was published disguised as an actual medieval romance
        from
        Italy, discovered and republished by a fictitious translator. Once revealed as modern, many found it
        anachronistic,
        reactionary, or simply in poor taste, but it proved immediately popular. Otranto inspired Vathek (1786) by
        William
        Beckford, A Sicilian Romance (1790), The Mysteries of Udolpho (1794), The Italian (1796) by Ann Radcliffe, and
        The
        Monk (1797) by Matthew Lewis. A significant amount of horror fiction of this era was written by women and
        marketed
        towards a female audience, a typical scenario of the novels being a resourceful female menaced in a gloomy
        castle.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>19th century</strong>
        <br>
        The Gothic tradition blossomed into the genre that modern readers today call horror literature in the 19th
        century.
        Influential works and characters that continue resonating in fiction and film today saw their genesis in the
        Brothers Grimm's "Hänsel und Gretel" (1812), Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus (1818), John
        Polidori's "The Vampyre" (1819), Charles Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (1820), Washington Irving's "The Legend
        of
        Sleepy Hollow" (1820), Jane C. Loudon's The Mummy!: Or a Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827), Victor Hugo's
        The
        Hunchback of Notre-Dame (1831), Thomas Peckett Prest's Varney the Vampire (1847), the works of Edgar Allan Poe,
        the
        works of Sheridan Le Fanu, Robert Louis Stevenson's Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886), Oscar Wilde's
        The
        Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Lot No. 249" (1892), H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man
        (1897),
        and Bram Stoker's Dracula (1897). Each of these works created an enduring icon of horror seen in later
        re-imaginings
        on the page, stage, and screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>20th century</strong>
        <br>
        A proliferation of cheap periodicals around the turn of the century led to a boom in horror writing. For
        example,
        Gaston Leroux serialized his Le Fantôme de l'Opéra before it became a novel in 1910. One writer who specialized
        in
        horror fiction for mainstream pulps, such as All-Story Magazine, was Tod Robbins, whose fiction deals with
        themes of
        madness and cruelty. In Russia, the writer Alexander Belyaev popularized these themes in his story Professor
        Dowell's Head (1925), in which a mad doctor performs experimental head transplants and reanimations on bodies
        stolen
        from the morgue and which was first published as a magazine serial before being turned into a novel. Later,
        specialist publications emerged to give horror writers an outlet, prominent among them was Weird Tales and
        Unknown Worlds.


        H. P. Lovecraft in 1915
        Influential horror writers of the early 20th century made inroads in these mediums. Particularly, the venerated
        horror author H. P. Lovecraft, and his enduring Cthulhu Mythos transformed and popularized the genre of cosmic
        horror, and M. R. James is credited with redefining the ghost story in that era.

        The serial murderer became a recurring theme. Yellow journalism and sensationalism of various murderers, such as
        Jack the Ripper, and lesser so, Carl Panzram, Fritz Haarman, and Albert Fish, all perpetuated this phenomenon.
        The
        trend continued in the postwar era, partly renewed after the murders committed by Ed Gein. In 1959, Robert
        Bloch,
        inspired by the murders, wrote Psycho. The crimes committed in 1969 by the Manson Family influenced the slasher
        theme in horror fiction of the 1970s. In 1981, Thomas Harris wrote Red Dragon, introducing Dr. Hannibal Lecter.
        In
        1988, the sequel to that novel, The Silence of the Lambs, was published.

        Early cinema was inspired by many aspects of horror literature, and started a strong tradition of horror films
        and
        subgenres that continues to this day. Up until the graphic depictions of violence and gore on the screen
        commonly
        associated with 1960s and 1970s slasher films and splatter films, comic books such as those published by EC
        Comics
        (most notably Tales From The Crypt) in the 1950s satisfied readers' quests for horror imagery that the silver
        screen
        could not provide. This imagery made these comics controversial, and as a consequence, they were frequently
        censored.

        The modern zombie tale dealing with the motif of the living dead harks back to works including H. P. Lovecraft's
        stories "Cool Air" (1925), "In The Vault" (1926), and "The Outsider" (1926), and Dennis Wheatley's "Strange
        Conflict" (1941). Richard Matheson's novel I Am Legend (1954) influenced an entire genre of apocalyptic zombie
        fiction emblematized by the films of George A. Romero.

        In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the enormous commercial success of three books - Rosemary's Baby (1967) by
        Ira
        Levin, The Exorcist by William Peter Blatty, and The Other by Thomas Tryon - encouraged publishers to begin
        releasing numerous other horror novels, thus creating a "horror boom".

        Stephen King
        Stephen King in 2007
        One of the best-known late-20th century horror writers is Stephen King, known for Carrie, The Shining, It,
        Misery,
        and several dozen other novels and about 200 short stories. Beginning in the 1970s, King's stories have
        attracted a large audience, for which he was awarded by the U.S. National Book Foundation in 2003. Other popular
        horror authors of the period included Anne Rice, Shaun Hutson, Brian Lumley, Graham Masterton, James Herbert,
        Dean
        Koontz, Richard Laymon, Clive Barker, Ramsey Campbell, and Peter Straub.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>21th century</strong>
        <br>
        Best-selling book series of contemporary times exist in genres related to horror fiction, such as the werewolf
        fiction urban fantasy Kitty Norville books by Carrie Vaughn (2005 onward). Horror elements continue to expand
        outside the genre. The alternate history of more traditional historical horror in Dan Simmons's 2007 novel The
        Terror sits on bookstore shelves next to genre mash ups such as Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009), and
        historical fantasy and horror comics such as Hellblazer (1993 onward) and Mike Mignola's Hellboy (1993 onward).
        Horror also serves as one of the central genres in more complex modern works such as Mark Z. Danielewski's House
        of
        Leaves (2000), a finalist for the National Book Award. There are many horror novels for children and teens, such
        as
        R. L. Stine's Goosebumps series or The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey. Additionally, many movies for young
        audiences, particularly animated ones, use horror aesthetics and conventions (for example, ParaNorman). These
        are
        what can be collectively referred to as "children's horror". Although it is unknown for sure why children enjoy
        these movies (as it seems counter-intuitive), it is theorized that it is, in part, grotesque monsters that
        fascinate
        kids. Tangential to this, the internalized impact of horror television programs and films on children is rather
        under-researched, especially when compared to the research done on the similar subject of violence in TV and
        film's
        impact on the young mind. What little research there is tends to be inconclusive on the impact that viewing such
        media has.
