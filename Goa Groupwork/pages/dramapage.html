            <p style="font-size: larger;"><strong>Drama</strong> is the specific mode of fiction represented in
                performance: a play, opera,
                mime, ballet, etc., performed in a theatre, or on radio or television. Considered as a genre of
                poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever
                since Aristotle's Poetics (c.335 BC)—the earliest work of dramatic theory.

                The term "drama" comes from a Greek word meaning "deed" or "act" (Classical Greek: δρᾶμα, drâma),
                which is derived from "I do" (Classical Greek: δράω, dráō). The two masks associated with drama
                represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy.
                <br>
                In English (as was the analogous case in many other European languages), the word play or game
                (translating the Anglo-Saxon pleġan or Latin ludus) was the standard term for dramas until William
                Shakespeare's time—just as its creator was a play-maker rather than a dramatist and the building was
                a play-house rather than a theatre.
                <br>
                The use of "drama" in a more narrow sense to designate a specific type of play dates from the modern
                era. "Drama" in this sense refers to a play that is neither a comedy nor a tragedy—for example,
                Zola's Thérèse Raquin (1873) or Chekhov's Ivanov (1887). It is this narrower sense that the film and
                television industries, along with film studies, adopted to describe "drama" as a genre within their
                respective media. The term "radio drama" has been used in both senses—originally transmitted in a
                live performance. It may also be used to refer to the more high-brow and serious end of the dramatic
                output of radio.
                <br>
                The enactment of drama in theatre, performed by actors on a stage before an audience, presupposes
                collaborative modes of production and a collective form of reception. The structure of dramatic
                texts, unlike other forms of literature, is directly influenced by this collaborative production and
                collective reception.
                <br>
                Mime is a form of drama where the action of a story is told only through the movement of the body.
                Drama can be combined with music: the dramatic text in opera is generally sung throughout; as for in
                some ballets dance "expresses or imitates emotion, character, and narrative action." Musicals
                include both spoken dialogue and songs; and some forms of drama have incidental music or musical
                accompaniment underscoring the dialogue (melodrama and Japanese Nō, for example). Closet drama is a
                form that is intended to be read, rather than performed. In improvisation, the drama does not
                pre-exist the moment of performance; performers devise a dramatic script spontaneously before an
                audience.

                • Films that are categorised under the genre drama
                have several main points that can be recognized
                in all of them.
                <br>
                • - They are serious representations of real life
                and/or stories and do not include fantasy in the
                plot.
                <br>
                • - Hence the name "drama" they show emotions
                and events at their true height, and perhaps
                dramatize them. They show emotions at their
                best and worst.

                    • The purpose of a dramatic storyline is to move the audience emotionally. Drama films depend mostly
                    on the development of realistic characters
                    dealing with emotional issues.
                    <br>
                    • In most cases the film concentrates on normal character(s) that is dealing with a conflict or
                    dilemma. Dramas often give actors a chance to stretch into a role that other genres wouldn’t
                    allow them to do. This is because drama films focus on building up characters that the audience
                    can engage with.
