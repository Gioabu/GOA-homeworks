        Science fiction (sometimes shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, which typically deals
        with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time
        travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It often explores human responses to changes in science
        and technology.

        Science fiction is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction and contains many subgenres. Its exact
        definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers. Subgenres include hard science
        fiction, which emphasizes scientific accuracy, and soft science fiction, focusing on social sciences. Other
        notable subgenres are cyberpunk, which explores the interface between technology and society, and climate
        fiction, addressing environmental issues.

        Precedents for science fiction are argued to exist as far back as antiquity, but the modern genre primarily
        arose in the 19th and early 20th centuries when popular writers began looking to technological progress and
        speculation. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818, is often credited as the first true science fiction
        novel. Jules Verne and H.G. Wells are pivotal figures in the genre's development. In the 20th century, expanded
        with the introduction of space operas, dystopian literature, pulp magazines, and the Golden Age of Science
        Fiction.

        Science fiction has been called the "literature of ideas", and continues to evolve, incorporating diverse voices
        and themes, influencing not just literature but film, TV, and culture at large. Besides providing entertainment
        it can also criticize present-day society and explore alternatives, and inspiration a "sense of wonder".
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Science Fiction vs. Fantasy</strong>
        <br>
        The genres of science fiction and fantasy are often considered to be part of an even larger genre known as
        speculative fiction, defined as “a broad literary genre encompassing any fiction with supernatural, fantastical,
        or futuristic elements.” Speculative fiction speculates about fictional worlds and characters completely
        different from our own or with elements outside of our reality. In other words, it’s fiction based on asking
        “What if…?”: What if we developed a technology that could allow us to travel to other galaxies? What if
        mythological figures were real?

        The first example about intergalactic travel is an example of a sci-fi premise. The second example about
        mythological figures is an example of a fantasy premise.

        The fantasy genre encompasses stories dealing with supernatural or unnatural events or characters, those that
        exist outside the realm of science and instead in the realm of magic and mythology.

        Science fiction and fantasy are usually differentiated from each other based on plausibility and how they
        explain the workings of the universe they depict. In general, the wonders (or horrors) of a science fiction
        story are depicted as the result of plausible scientific advances. In contrast, the elements of fantasy often
        rely on supernatural or mystical explanations (if they are explained at all).

        For example, both a science fiction and a fantasy story may have a character who is able to shoot lighting from
        their hands. If a character is able to do this because they have a genetic mutation or machinery in their hand,
        this would be classified as science fiction. If, on the other hand, the character is able to do this because of
        magic or because they are a god (which are outside the realm of science), this would be classified as a work of
        fantasy.

        But stories aren’t always so easily distinguished. Remember, these genres are artificial ways of classifying
        stories. Many stories blur the lines between the two genres, or have elements of both, or transcend the idea of
        genre altogether.

        As sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke said: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”

        <strong>Examples of Science Fiction</strong>
        <br>
        Science fiction began as a literary genre. It has spawned written works in many forms, including countless
        novels, short stories, and works of flash fiction. But the genre is also extremely popular in other forms of
        media, including comic books, graphic novels, movies, shows, and video games.

        In general, there are certain topics, themes, and plots that frequently appear in many science fiction stories.
        These include but are not limited to:

        •space travel
        <br>
        •time travel
        <br>
        •robots
        <br>
        •artificial intelligence
        <br>
        •advanced computing
        <br>
        •virtual reality
        <br>
        •extraterrestrial life
        <br>
        •genetic experimentation
        <br>
        •cloning
        <br>
        •transhumanism
        However, not every sci-fi story is set in the far future or includes super-advanced technology. Some sci-fi
        works include more subtle elements, including in worlds that look much like our own.

    <p style="font-size: larger;">The literary genre of science fiction is diverse, and its exact definition remains a
        contested question among
        both scholars and devotees. This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history,
        particularly over determining its exact origins. There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the
        genre's roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh (earliest Sumerian text versions
        c. 2150–2000 BCE). A second approach argues that science fiction only became possible sometime between the
        17th and early 19th centuries, following the scientific revolution and major discoveries in astronomy, physics,
        and mathematics.

        Science fiction developed and boomed in the 20th century, as the deep integration of science and inventions into
        daily life encouraged a greater interest in literature that explores the relationship between technology,
        society, and the individual. Scholar Robert Scholes calls the history of science fiction "the history of
        humanity's changing attitudes toward space and time ... the history of our growing understanding of the universe
        and the position of our species in that universe". In recent decades, the genre has diversified and become
        firmly established as a major influence on global culture and thought.

        <strong>The “golden age” of science fiction</strong>
        <br>
        The previously mentioned Hugo Gernsback, an emigrant from Luxembourg based in New York City, made a living
        publishing technical magazines for radio and electrical enthusiasts. Noting the growing fondness of his youthful
        audience for fictional accounts of thrilling technical wonders, Gernsback began to republish the works of Verne
        and Poe and the early writings of H.G. Wells in great profusion.
        <br>
        Gernsback’s magazine "Amazing Stories" (founded 1926) broke ground for many imitators and successors, including
        his own later periodicals Science Wonder Stories, Air Wonder Stories, and Scientific Detective Monthly (later
        known as Amazing Detective Tales), and a torrent of other pulp publications. This practice soon yielded so much
        fruit that many people, especially Americans, falsely assumed that Americans had created science fiction.
        <br>
        In contrast to earlier decades, traditional science fiction of the late 1960s and early ’70s reached
        unprecedented popularity on television and in film. American SF television series, such as "Star Trek" (1966–69;
        founded by Gene Roddenberry), may have primed film producers and audiences alike for cinema adaptations of
        “serious” science fiction. "Fahrenheit 451" (1966), "2001: A Space Odyssey" (1968), and "Charly" (1968)—based on
        works
        by Bradbury, Clarke, and Daniel Keyes, respectively—earned critical praise and attracted a growing number of
        directors and actors to the genre. If any doubt remained about the commercial viability of SF cinema, the
        blockbuster movies "Star Wars" (1977), "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" (1977), and "E.T.: The
        Extra-Terrestrial"
        (1982) proved that science fiction had finally moved beyond its drive-in B-film status. In fact, U.S. box-office
        receipts for science fiction, fantasy, and horror films jumped from 5 percent in 1971 to nearly 50 percent by
        1982; although the share fell somewhat in subsequent years, science fiction continued to be one of the most
        important Hollywood movie formats.
        <br>
        The spectacular nature of science fiction’s thematics played very strongly to Hollywood’s technical advantages
        over rival cinemas in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and Mumbai (then Bombay). After the 1970s, the American SF film
        with its state-of-the-art special effects became science fiction’s public face. Science fiction films such as
        the "Terminator" series (1984, 1991, 2003, 2009, 2015), the "Alien" series (1979, 1986, 1992, 1997), and the
        "Jurassic Park" series (1993, 1997, 2001, 2015) became major money earners worldwide.
