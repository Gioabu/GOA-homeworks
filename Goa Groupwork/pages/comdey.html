    <p style="font-size: larger;">Comedy is a genre that consists of discourses or works intended to be humorous or
        amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, film, stand-up comedy, television, radio, books, or any
        other entertainment medium. The term originated in ancient Greece: In Athenian democracy, the public opinion of
        voters was influenced by political satire performed by comic poets in theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek
        comedy can be described as a dramatic performance pitting two groups, ages, genders, or societies against each
        other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a "Society of Youth"
        and a "Society of the Old".A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a
        relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions posing obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the
        youth then becomes constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to resort to
        ruses which engender dramatic irony, which provokes laughter.

        Satire and political satire use comedy to portray people or social institutions as ridiculous or corrupt, thus
        alienating their audience from the object of their humor. Parody subverts popular genres and forms, critiquing
        those forms without necessarily condemning them.

        Other forms of comedy include screwball comedy, which derives its humor largely from bizarre, surprising (and
        improbable) situations or characters, and black comedy, which is characterized by a form of humor that includes
        darker aspects of human behavior or human nature. Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor
        create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways, which can often be taken as offensive by
        the subjects of the joke. A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society
        (usually upper-class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members.
        Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles
        of those who are falling in love.</p>

    <p style="font-size: larger;">Starting from 425 BCE, Aristophanes, a comic play and satirical author of the Ancient
        Greek Theater, wrote 40 comedies, 11 of which survive. Aristophanes developed his type of comedy from the
        earlier satyr plays, which were often highly obscene. The only surviving examples of the satyr plays are by
        Euripides, which are much later examples and not representative of the genre. In ancient Greece, comedy
        originated in bawdy and ribald songs or recitations apropos of phallic processions and fertility festivals or
        gatherings.

        Around 335 BCE, Aristotle, in his work Poetics, stated that comedy originated in phallic processions and the
        light treatment of the otherwise base and ugly. He also adds that the origins of comedy are obscure because it
        was not treated seriously from its inception. However, comedy had its own Muse: Thalia.[citation needed]

        Aristotle taught that comedy was generally positive for society, since it brings forth happiness, which for
        Aristotle was the ideal state, the final goal in any activity. For Aristotle, a comedy did not need to involve
        sexual humor. A comedy is about the fortunate rise of a sympathetic character. Aristotle divides comedy into
        three categories or subgenres: farce, romantic comedy, and satire. On the other hand, Plato taught that comedy
        is a destruction to the self. He believed that it produces an emotion that overrides rational self-control and
        learning. In The Republic, he says that the guardians of the state should avoid laughter, "for ordinarily when
        one abandons himself to violent laughter, his condition provokes a violent reaction." Plato says comedy should
        be tightly controlled if one wants to achieve the ideal state.

        Also in Poetics, Aristotle defined comedy as one of the original four genres of literature. The other three
        genres are tragedy, epic poetry, and lyric poetry. Literature, in general, is defined by Aristotle as a mimesis,
        or imitation of life. Comedy is the third form of literature, being the most divorced from a true mimesis.
        Tragedy is the truest mimesis, followed by epic poetry, comedy, and lyric poetry. The genre of comedy is defined
        by a certain pattern according to Aristotle's definition. Comedies begin with low or base characters seeking
        insignificant aims and end with some accomplishment of the aims which either lightens the initial baseness or
        reveals the insignificance of the aims.

        <strong>20th century film, records, radio, and television.</strong>
        <br>
        The advent of cinema in the late 19th century, and later radio and television in the 20th century broadened the
        access of comedians to the general public. Charlie Chaplin, through silent film, became one of the best-known
        faces on Earth. The silent tradition lived on well into the late 20th century through mime artists like Marcel
        Marceau, and the slapstick comedy of artists like Rowan Atkinson (as Mr. Bean). The tradition of the circus
        clown also continued, with such as Bozo the Clown in the United States and Oleg Popov in Russia. Radio provided
        new possibilities — with Britain producing the influential surreal humour of the Goon Show after the Second
        World War. The Goons' influence spread to the American radio and recording troupe the Firesign Theatre. American
        cinema has produced a great number of globally renowned comedy artists, from Laurel and Hardy, the Three
        Stooges, Abbott and Costello, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Bob Hope and Phyllis Diller during the mid-20th
        century, to performers like George Carlin, Bill Cosby, Joan Rivers, Robin Williams, and Eddie Murphy toward the
        end of the century. Hollywood attracted many international talents like the British comics Peter Sellers, Dudley
        Moore and Sacha Baron Cohen, Canadian comics Dan Aykroyd, Jim Carrey, and Mike Myers, and the Australian
        comedian Paul Hogan, famous for Crocodile Dundee. Other centres of creative comic activity have been the cinema
        of Hong Kong, Bollywood, and French farce.

        American television has also been an influential force in world comedy: with American series like M*A*S*H,
        Seinfeld and The Simpsons achieving large followings around the world. British television comedy also remains
        influential, with quintessential works including Fawlty Towers, Monty Python, Dad's Army, Blackadder, and The
        Office. Australian satirist Barry Humphries, whose comic creations include the housewife and "gigastar" Dame
        Edna Everage, for his delivery of Dadaist and absurdist humour to millions, was described by biographer Anne
        Pender in 2010 as not only "the most significant theatrical figure of our time ... [but] the most significant
        comedian to emerge since Charlie Chaplin".
