        Romance films involve romantic love stories recorded in visual media for broadcast in theatres or on television
        that focus on passion, emotion, and the affectionate romantic involvement of the main characters. Typically
        their journey through dating, courtship or marriage is featured. These films make the search for romantic love
        the main plot focus. Occasionally, romance lovers face obstacles such as finances, physical illness, various
        forms of discrimination, psychological restraints or family resistance. As in all quite strong, deep and close
        romantic relationships, the tensions of day-to-day life, temptations (of infidelity), and differences in
        compatibility enter into the plots of romantic films.
        <br>

        Romantic films often explore the essential themes of love at first sight, young and mature love, unrequited
        love, obsession, sentimental love, spiritual love, forbidden love, platonic love, sexual and passionate love,
        sacrificial love, explosive and destructive love, and tragic love. Romantic films serve as great escapes and
        fantasies for viewers, especially if the two leads finally overcome their difficulties, declare their love, and
        experience their "happily ever after", often implied by a reunion and final kiss. In romantic television series,
        the development of such romantic relationships may play out over many episodes or different characters may
        become intertwined in different romantic arcs.
        <br>

        Screenwriter and scholar Eric R. Williams identifies Romance Films as one of eleven super-genres in his
        screenwriters' taxonomy, claiming that all feature length narrative films can be classified by these
        super-genres. The other ten super-genres are action, crime, fantasy, horror, science fiction, comedy, sports,
        thriller, war and western.

        <strong>Historical romance</strong>
        <br>
        Also known as epic romance, this is a romantic story with a historical period setting, normally with a turbulent
        backdrop of war, revolution, or tragedy. This includes films such as Gone with the Wind, Doctor Zhivago, Reds,
        Titanic, A Very Long Engagement, Atonement, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, and Cold War.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Paranormal romance</strong>
        <br>
        Paranormal romance is a popular genre of film which features romantic relationships between humans and
        supernatural creatures. Popular tropes include vampirism, time travel, ghosts and psychic or telekinetic
        abilities – i.e. things that cannot be explained by science. The genre originated in literature and moved on
        to the screen in the early 2000s, following the success of the Twilight Saga adaptations from Stephenie Meyer's
        books. By 2007–08, film studios were producing various paranormal romance films, many adapted from novels.

        Examples of paranormal romance films include "The Exterminating Angel", "The Twilight Saga", "Warm Bodies",
        "Vampire
        Academy", "I Am Dragon", and "The Shape of Water".
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Romantic comedy</strong>
        <br>
        Romantic comedies are films with light-hearted, humorous plotlines, centered on romantic ideals such as that
        true love is able to surmount most obstacles. Humour in such films tends to be of a verbal, low-key variety or
        situational, as opposed to slapstick. Films within this genre include "City Lights", "A Night at the Opera", "It
        Happened One Night", "His Girl Friday", "The Philadelphia Story", "Intolerable Cruelty", "Roman
        Holiday", "Good Morning, My Dear Wife", "The Big Sick", "Enough Said", "Lost In Translation", "To All the Boys
        I've Loved
        Before".
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Romantic drama</strong>
        <br>
        Romantic dramas usually revolve around an obstacle that prevents deep and true love between two people. Music is
        often employed to indicate the emotional mood, creating an atmosphere of greater insulation for the couple. The
        conclusion of a romantic drama typically does not indicate whether a final romantic union between the two main
        characters will occur.

        Some examples of romantic drama films and shows before 2000 are "Man's Way with Women", "Casablanca", "María
        Candelaria", "Appointment with Happiness", "Wakeful Eyes", "Among the Ruins", "The River of Love",
        "Dearer than my Life", Love Story, and "Paris and Love"
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Romantic fantasy</strong>
        <br>
        Romantic fantasies describe fantasy stories using many of the elements and conventions of the romance genre.
        Some examples include "The Lady Eve", "Top Hat", "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Les Parapluies de Cherbourg)"",
        "Singin'
        in the Rain", "Groundhog Day", "Enchanted", "Cinderella" and "Beauty and the Beast".
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Romantic musical</strong>
        <br>
        Romantic musical (alternatively musical romance) is a genre of film which features romantic relationships and
        whose story is partially explained through song and/or dance numbers. This genre originated on Broadway and
        moved to the silver screen thanks in part to the popularity of the Rodgers and Hammerstein productions.

        Some examples include "South Pacific", "West Side Story" and its "2021 remake", "Grease", "High School Musical",
        "Across
        the Universe", "Moulin Rouge!", the "Mamma Mia!" franchise, "Sunshine on Leith", and "La La Land".

    <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Of all the movie genres that we are familiar with today, few have a longer history than romance. Not
        surprisingly, the romance movie has changed almost out of all recognition since the days of the silent movie,
        reflecting changes in society, but perhaps more importantly, reflecting the ingenuity and inventiveness of the
        moviemakers and actors who have shaped the genre.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Origins</strong>
        <br>
        The original romance movie was also the shortest. At just 20 seconds long, The Kiss (1896) featured two famous
        stage actors kissing. The scene, taken from the Broadway show The Widow Jones, was considered scandalous at the
        time, but the short movie, shown on a projector known as a Vitoscope, was also wildly popular.
        <br>
        Many of the elements that shaped the genre could be found in embryonic form in the early years of the romance
        movie, including the pairing of famous screen couples. One of the first such partnerships began in the era of
        the silent movies, between Greta Garbo and John Gilbert. The MGM actors first appeared in Flesh and the Devil
        (1926) and went on to star in a number of notable early romance classics, their on-screen chemistry no doubt
        influenced by the fact that they were engaged in a relationship off screen.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Classic romantic dramas</strong>
        <br>
        The time of WW2 was also a golden age of romantic cinema, perhaps because audiences were keen to escape the
        horrors of reality for a fantasy world of romance. Some of the genres greatest works of art were created during
        this time, including "Gone with the Wind" (1939) starring Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable; quintessential British
        romance "Brief Encounter" (1946); and arguably the most romantic film of all time, "Casablanca" (1942).
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Return of the romantic comedy</strong>
        <br>
        The 1950s and early 1960s were a time of increasing prosperity in the West, and in keeping with the general
        mood, there was a return to popularity for the romantic comedy, which was typified by a series of films
        featuring Doris Day and Rock Hudson, "including Pillow Talk" (1959), "Lover Come Back" (1951) and "Send Me No
        Flowers"
        (1964).
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>80s and 90s variety</strong>
        <br>
        The last two decades of the 20th century saw an explosion in the number and variety of romance movies.
        Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour starred in "Somewhere in Time" (1980), which can claim to be the first ever
        science fiction romance. The 1980s also saw the beginning of the romance thriller, with such classics as The
        "Year of Living Dangerously" (1982), in which Mel Gibson and Sigourney Weavers romance is played against the
        backdrop of a coup in 1960s Indonesia.

        This was also the period in which British romantic comedy dominated the box office, with such titles as "Notting
        Hill" (1999), "Bridget Joness Diary" (2001) and "Love Actually" (2003), all
        starring English actor Hugh Grant. In 1997 came the ultimate in historical romance movies, "Titanic", which also
        employed state-of-the-art special effects.
        <br>
        <br>
        <strong>The modern era</strong>
        <br>
        The 21st century has so far seen something of a decline in romance films, as the public appears to have lost
        their appetite, particularly for romantic comedies, which increasingly felt formulaic and dated. In particular,
        the tendency for romance movies to default to a 1950s-era standard of strong male leads sweeping female
        characters off their feet feels dated. This wont have gone unnoticed by Hollywood executives, from Ryan
        Kavanaugh to Jerry Bruckheimer, whose role is to spot the trends in audience tastes as they develop.

        However, given its long history, few could bet against the revival of the romantic movie in years to come.
